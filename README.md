# FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Projects

Welcome to my repository of **Responsive Web Design Projects** completed as part of the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/elyphus) certification program. This collection showcases my progress and understanding of HTML and CSS through various hands-on projects.

  A responsive survey form showcasing form elements, input types, and accessibility best practices.

  A simple product landing page that uses Flexbox for layout and media queries for responsiveness.
